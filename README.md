I'm the Leslie machine, a jack of all trades. I love to learn stuff so much that I am not excellent at anything, just good at some things. For some that is good, for gatekeepers it's bad.

Generative stuff makes me happy. Open-source makes me happy. Computational biology, Art, Metal, love, good series, good education, learning languages (human and otherwise) getting funding for reaserch, all good things if you ask me.

Reach me by googling leslie machine, or my name, or whatever, it's not difficult to find me.
